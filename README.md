As apart of the FNB App Academy we had to create this website in week 3.
Zoo Webpage
Welcome to the Zoo Webpage project — a static HTML-based website that offers an interactive tour of a fictional zoo. 1
This project includes individual pages for various animals, attractions, and amenities within the zoo, designed to provide an engaging and educational online zoo experience.

🌐 Live Preview
You can open `index.html` in a browser to begin exploring the zoo experience locally.
