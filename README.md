As apart of the FNB App Academy we had to create this website in week 3.

Zoo Webpage
A static, multi-page website that simulates a virtual zoo experience. This project showcases a collection of HTML pages representing various zoo attractions, animal exhibits, and visitor amenities. Ideal for educational demonstrations, portfolio projects, or mock website development.

📸 Overview
The Zoo Webpage provides a structured, browser-based tour of a fictional zoo. Each page is designed to highlight a specific section of the zoo, from animal enclosures to dining areas and visitor feedback forms.
